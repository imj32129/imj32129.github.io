		<H3>Astros Win It All<img src="Baseball.jpg" alt="Baseball Stadium" width="400" height="250" align="right" hspace="100"></h3>
		<P>The Houston Astros finished off the <abbr title="Major League Baseball">MLB</abbr> season with a win in Game 7 of the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
		As you can see in the table below, the series was very competitive. The orange rows stand for games the Astros won, whereas the blue rows stand for games the Dodgers won.</P>
		<P>It came down to the very end in Game 7, but the Astros were able to pull away and win it all. The Astros were led by many stars including one of the <small>smallest players in the league, Jose Altuve.</small> However, it was Astros outfielder, George Springer who was awarded the MVP for his stellar play in the 7 games.
		Springer hit with an unbelievable batting average of .379 and had 5 homeruns in the World Series. <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/springe01.shtml#batting_postseason::none">Check Out More of Springer's stats from the World Series here!</a> To top off his incredible run, Springer proposed to his girlfriend shortly after winning the MVP.</P><P> 
		This was the first World Series Championship for the Astros organization, and they expect many more with their young core of talent. This World Series was one for the history books, and the Astros should be proud of their accomplishments.</P>
